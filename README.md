Volume Logic Trading Assistant - Technical Documentation
Executive Summary
The Volume Logic Trading Assistant is an advanced algorithmic system developed in PineScript v5 for the TradingView platform. The indicator implements a systematic trading strategy based on volume profile analysis, integrated with dynamic support and resistance systems and multi-timeframe analysis.
System Objectives
The algorithm has been designed to:

Automate the identification of high-probability trading opportunities
Reduce risk through a scalar position system
Optimize entry points based on advanced volumetric analysis
Provide objective and replicable trading signals

Technical Architecture
1. Core Components
1.1 Volume Profile Analysis
The system calculates real-time volume distribution across 100 price levels, identifying:

Point of Control (POC): the price level with the highest traded volume
Value Area High/Low (VAH/VAL): the boundaries of the value area containing 60-70% of volume
Liquidity zones based on volumetric voids
Secondary volume peaks to identify hidden support/resistance levels

1.2 Dynamic Pivot System
The algorithm utilizes four different pivot timeframes:

Standard Pivots: based on half the analysis period (bbars/2)
Old Pivots: extended period for long-term trends
Fast Pivots: 13 periods for rapid reactions
Break Pivots: quarter period for breakout identification

1.3 Statistical Trend Analysis

Linear regression with Pearson coefficient (R)
2-sigma standard deviation bands
Automatic identification of trend direction and strength
Price interpolation for future projections

2. Trading System
2.1 Position Classification
Base Positions (ID 1-2)

Opens on main support when bottom corresponds to a pivot
Sizing: base multiplier * number of securities
Targets: based on subsequent Fibonacci levels

Cover Positions (ID 3-10)

4-level system for controlled averaging down
Progressive activation with incremental distances
Reduced sizing for risk management

Mid-Range Positions (ID 11-12)

Opens on significant volume levels (VAL, POC, VAH)
Used when market is in accumulation phase
More conservative targets compared to base positions

Breakout Positions (ID 13, 23)

Activated on key resistance breaks
"Siffredi" pattern to capture extreme movements
Increased sizing to exploit momentum

2.2 Risk Management
The system implements multiple risk management strategies:

Dynamic stop losses based on structural supports
Adaptive position sizing to market sentiment
Maximum limit of concurrent open positions
Alert system for preventive closures

3. Market Sentiment Analysis
3.1 External Indicators

VIX Index: implied volatility measurement
SDEX: proprietary market direction indicator
CMF (Chaikin Money Flow): monetary flow analysis

3.2 Regime Score
The system calculates a composite score (-6 to +6) that determines:

Opening aggressiveness
Target distances
Position sizing

4. Pattern Recognition
The algorithm identifies six main market patterns:

Trend Up: Optimal conditions for long positions
Trend Down: Bear market, defensive positions only
Fall Accumula Liq: Lateral accumulation phase
Fall Spike Up: Counter-trend spike, mean reversion opportunity
Switch Up Trend: Bullish reversal phase
No Buy Pattern: Unfavorable trading conditions

Operational Implementation
Configuration Parameters
Main Parameters:
- percent: 60 (percentage weight for Value Area calculation)
- bbars: 360 (number of bars for analysis, must be even)
- piv_distance: 50 (base distance for cover positions)
Alert System
Alerts are generated in structured JSON format for integration with automated execution systems:
Alert Structure:
- timeframe: signal time period
- action: OPEN/CLOSE
- id: unique position identifier (1-23)
- epic: security symbol
- direction: BUY/SELL
- size: number of contracts/shares

Minimum 1000 historical bars
Real-time calculation updates
Optimized for timeframes from 5 minutes to 1 hour

Performance Metrics
The system continuously monitors:

Win rate by position type
Maximum drawdown
Sharpe ratio
Profit factor

Maintenance and Updates
Dependencies

PineScript version 5
Proprietary library: MPELAM/Logic_Trade_Bot_Library_penny/24
